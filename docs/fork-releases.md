# Fork app updates (maxkongerskov/ollama)

The macOS app in this fork updates itself only from GitHub releases of
[maxkongerskov/ollama](https://github.com/maxkongerskov/ollama). It never
asks ollama.com or ollama/ollama. The updater lives in `app/updater/`.

## What the updater installs

The app polls `https://api.github.com/repos/maxkongerskov/ollama/releases/latest`
3 seconds after launch and then every hour. Drafts and prereleases are never
"latest", so they are ignored.

- **Asset:** the first `.zip` whose name contains `darwin` and the Mac's arch
  (`arm64`/`aarch64` or `amd64`/`x86_64`). If none matches, any `.zip` that
  does not name another arch (e.g. `-darwin-universal.zip`). A DMG is never
  installed by the updater; a release with only a DMG is skipped.
- **Zip layout:** `Ollama.app/` at the root and nothing else. Make it with
  `ditto -c -k --norsrc --keepParent Ollama.app X.zip`. Do not use
  `--sequesterRsrc`: its `__MACOSX/` entries make the updater reject the zip.
- **Signature:** the extracted `Ollama.app` must pass the Security framework's
  static code check (same as `codesign --verify --deep --strict`). Our builds
  are signed with Developer ID team `6LZ2DS9JPD`. Notarization isn't needed
  for the in-app update, because the app writes the files itself and they are
  not quarantined. A DMG that people download still needs notarization for
  Gatekeeper.
- **Version:** the app's version is `git describe` output, e.g.
  `0.35.1-b11325-glm5next-unload-9-g6c178a3-dirty`. The updater removes the
  `-N-gSHA[-dirty]` suffix and compares the rest with the release tag minus `v`:
  - same tag: no update, so an installed release is never offered again;
  - higher `X.Y.Z`, or the same `X.Y.Z` with a higher `bNNNNN`: update;
  - lower: never offered (no downgrades);
  - same numbers, different suffix (`-glm5next` → `-glm5next-keepalive`):
    offered only if the release was published after the running app was
    installed.

  The app has to be built from exactly the release tag. If it isn't, the
  updated app reports a different tag and keeps being offered the same
  release. `scripts/release_fork_darwin.sh` enforces this.

## Cutting an update

```sh
# 1. Commit, tag, push (new tag = new suffix and/or bumped version)
git tag v0.35.1-b11325-glm5next-keepalive
git push origin main v0.35.1-b11325-glm5next-keepalive

# 2. Build a signed Ollama.app from that tag (clean tree, or the version gets -dirty)
git checkout v0.35.1-b11325-glm5next-keepalive
APPLE_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Max Køngerskov (6LZ2DS9JPD)" \
  ./scripts/build_darwin.sh -a arm64          # -> dist/Ollama.app
#    or let the release script call build_darwin.sh: add --build in step 3

# 3. Check, then publish the zip (+ optional DMG) to the fork's release
./scripts/release_fork_darwin.sh --dry-run
./scripts/release_fork_darwin.sh [--dmg dist/Ollama.dmg]
```

The release script:

- refuses to run unless `origin` is `maxkongerskov/ollama`, and always calls
  `gh` with `--repo maxkongerskov/ollama`;
- checks the app's version matches the tag, its signature, and team ID;
- notarizes and staples it when credentials are configured
  (`--notary-profile NAME`/`NOTARY_PROFILE`, or
  `APPLE_ID`/`APPLE_PASSWORD`/`APPLE_TEAM_ID`). Without them it skips this step;
- writes `dist/fork-release/<tag>/Ollama-<version>-darwin-<arch>.zip`;
- verifies the zip with `codesign` and the updater's own `VerifyDownload`;
- creates the release with `--latest`, or uploads to the existing one with
  `--clobber`, and adds `sha256sum.txt`.

Running apps pick up the update at their next hourly check, or 3 seconds
after a restart. With auto-update on, the zip is downloaded to
`~/Library/Caches/ollama/updates/<etag-hash>/` and the menu bar shows
"update available". The update is installed when you choose it there or on
the next app launch.
